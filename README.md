A Scientific Computing Tool

A good mathematical tool should belong to all mankind, This tool will gradually become more powerful with the
participation of anyone who is interested in mathematics, and accordingly, the tool will be provided free of charge to
anyone, without discrimination based on his skin color, his ethnicity, or his religious beliefs.

This tool currently has very few features, and we hope that interested developers will participate in its development or
provide valuable feedback so that Tiger can one day help solve mathematical problems around the world. To conclude,
let's borrow a quote from the ancient Chinese philosopher Xunzi:
"道虽迩，不行不至；事虽小，不为不成" it means The path is near, but not taking steps will not get you there; the task is small, but not
doing it will not complete it."
